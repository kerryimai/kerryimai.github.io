<!--
  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was interesting seeing how different we wireframe our pages, and I got to learn about the software that my partner uses to do his framing.
  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes, it makes me think deeper and a step further on what and how I want to design my page, and why.
  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  simple, clear design is what we think would work for now.
  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  I learned about Div from Joseph, it seems to show that its a division.
