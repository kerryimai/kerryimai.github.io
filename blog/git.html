  <p>What are the benefits of version control?
      Version control in programing helps you keep track of the different changes that were made to your code. But why do you need these records? You can think of it as those 30 pages long research papers you had to do for school. You would mostly likely have to have several rough drafts and piece together different discussions to make up a final draft that is 30 pages long and is finely polished with almost perfect editing. Sometimes you might start of in one direction, and discover different or even better ways to support your points in the paper. When you encounter situation like that, would you rather rewrite the entire draft or save as much as you can of the work that is useful for your new direction? If you are as lazy as me, you would want to choose the second. Same in programming, sometimes when you code, you might encounter situations which you decide not to include the new changes into the code you had so far, or you want to reverse some changes you made awhile ago because it's not suitable anymore. If it is a huge project, it would take a lot of time trying to remenber when and where were those specific changes made. However with version control, you can easily search the particular one you were looking for by checking the commit message section (a message made by the person who commits a change that explains what changes have been made to the code). This is especially true during group projects where several people are working on the same code. Finding a change that one of your teammate made 3 weeks ago can be a huge struggle, but if the record of changes are clearly listed, this process would be much easier. Thus, version control helps improve the quality of team work, and also help programmers save time and energy by keeping track of each changes.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      Git is a system that lets you use version control. Each time when you commit a change, it is saved with git with the date, the person who made the change, and the comment of the commit (the reason for change). You can ask git to show you the entire list of the change records to a file. It is an easy to use, fast, and clean way to conduct version control.

      Why use GitHub to store your code?
      By using Github, which is a server for git, people can share their code online with other people. It allows others to help you make better your code, or modify it so to fit their own legal purposes. I personally understand it as a fast, and safe social network for programmers, where people can use to work with others online, and share their knowledge and news.
