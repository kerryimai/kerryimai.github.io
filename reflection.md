What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
CSS padding is the space between the context and the border. The border is the edge of the element. Margin is the space between the boarder of the element and other elements or edge of the site. Ive learn that if there is already a certain margin space between this element and its surrounding, setting a margin that is smaller than that space is most likely not going to move the element furthur away. I've also learned from self reserach that it is a good habit to set all element margin and padding to 0 at the begining on the stylesheet.
What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Ive learned that a lot of the element positions are interelated when formatting, and I should not only focus on the element that I would like to move, but also pay attention to see if other element's styling is obstructing what I am trying to do with the selected element.
What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I find setting the font, color, size is the easiest overall. However, the positioning of the side bars and different sections took a lot of time. Float and clear didnt work great for me, as it most of the time did not work the way I hoped it would.
What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that it is important to first write a clean and organized code on HTML. Throughout my challenge, I kept going back and almost changed everything in my html files beecasue they were not well written and organized enough. When formatting on CSS, it is important to check if some codes are in the way of each other, for example: I changed the position of one element to inline hoping it would sit on the same line as the other. and took me awhile to realize that I also needed to change the other element's position to inline in order for it to work.
